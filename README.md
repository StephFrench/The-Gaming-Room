# The-Gaming-Room
Software design document for The Gaming Room

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room has a game, Draw It or Lose It, that is only available to Android users. Creative Technology Solutions has been enlisted to develop a similar game this is web-based and able to serve multiple platforms.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I fully understood what the client was asking for and I provided options for them based on their particular needs.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
While creating this design document I feel like I put myself in the shoes of the client. I tried to envision what the game should look like based on the users input and then researched to ensure I was giving them what I believe to be the best options based on their needs.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part of my work that I would like to revise is the “Development Requirements” section of the design document.
I gave a broad, less personalized answer and I wish I had taken a bit more time trying to personalize the development requirements for the server side, client side and development tools.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?
Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user asked for the following:
• Web-based
• Works on multiple platforms
• Four rounds of play, lasting one minute each
• Ability to gradually render images from a library of drawings, completing and expiring at 30 second mark
• Allow remaining teams 15 seconds to offer a guess if current team cannot complete puzzle
• Support one or more teams
• Ability to assign players to teams
• Require Teams/Players to select a unique name
• Check that each Team/Player name is unique
• Check that only one instance of the game exists in memory at any given time
By carefully reviewing ALL of the needs of the client I was able to personalize every aspect of the design to them. Its imperative that the client feel like what they are asking is being fully realized. If we cannot do at least that for the client they lose confidence in our abilities to create something that embodies the company. If I didn’t have confidence in someone who was developing software for me, I would quickly move on to finding someone else who better understands my needs.

# How did you approach designing software?
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software with an unbiased mind. I took notes on what the client had envisioned their game to look like and made recommendations based on what I believed would work best. In the future I believe I would use a similar approach. I do feel like I understood what the clients needs were and because of that I was able to customize my design document to each of their requirements.
